# Security

## Login attempts

The MFA module makes use of the framework's `LoginAttempt` API to ensure that a user can only attempt to register
or verify a MFA method a certain number of times. Since it re-uses the core API, it also shares the maximum number
of attempts with login attempts themselves.

For example: if the maximum number of login attempts (`Member.lock_out_after_incorrect_logins`) is 5, and a user
incorrectly enters their password twice, correctly enters it once, then incorrectly enters a TOTP code three times,
they will be registered as locked out for a specified period of time (`Member.lock_out_delay_mins`). In this case,
the user will be shown a message when trying to verify their TOTP code similar to "Your account is temporarily locked.
Please try again later."
