# Backup codes

Backup codes are random strings that are provided as recovery options in case a member loses their ability to
verify with their registered multi-factor authentication methods, e.g. they lost their phone or security key.

## Generating backup codes

Backup codes are generated by the `BackupCodeGeneratorInterface` service, which has a default implementation of
`SilverStripe\MFA\Service\BackupCodeGenerator`. This service will hash the generated backup codes using the
default SilverStripe `PasswordEncryptor` service and algorithm, and returns an array of
`SilverStripe\MFA\State\BackupCode` instances.

You can use this service class to generate codes:

```php
$generator = Injector::inst()->get(BackupCodeGeneratorInterface::class);
$codes = $generator->generate();
```

## Verifying backup codes

To verify a backup code, you can reconstruct a `BackupCode` instance from stored data on the `RegisteredMethod`
instance and use `BackupCode::isValid()` to verify the input. For example:

```php
$storedCodeData = json_decode($registeredMethod->Data, true);
foreach ($storedCodeData as $codeCandidate) {
    // Expected structure: ['hash' => 'abc123', 'algorithm' => 'blowfish', 'salt' => 'bae']
    $candidate = json_decode($codeCandidate, true);

    $backupCode = BackupCode::create($userInputCode, $candidate['hash'], $candidate['algorithm'], $candidate['salt']);
    if ($backupCode->isValid()) {
        // The user entered a valid backup code, do as you please now.
    }
}
```

The default implementation of this logic is in `VerifyHandler::verify()`.

## BackupCodeGenerator

This configuration documentation applies to the default `BackupCodeGenerator` implementation of
`BackupCodeGeneratorInterface`.

### Configuration

You can adjust either the length of the backup code strings, or the number of them that are generated, by setting
YAML configuration:

```yaml
SilverStripe\MFA\Service\BackupCodeGenerator:
  # Should be 12 characters long
  backup_code_length: 12
  # I want 25 of them
  backup_code_count: 25
```

### Adjusting the character sets

By default, backup codes will be generated using upper and lowercase letters and numbers. If you would like to increase
the entropy of your backup codes by adding special characters, you can do so by adding an extension:

```php
class BackupCodeGeneratorExtension extends Extension
{
    /**
     * Add some special characters into the character set for generating backup codes
     */
    public function updateCharacterSet(&$characterSet)
    {
        $characterSet = array_merge($characterSet, ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^']);
    }
}
```

This extension should be applied to `SilverStripe\MFA\Service\BackupCodeGenerator` via YAML configuration.
