summary: How to acquire and configure an Authenticator app for your phone

# Using authenticator apps

## Installing an authenticator app

Before you can setup MFA on your account you’ll need to install an authenticator
app on your phone which supports Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), such as:

- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator)

## Setting up with an authenticator app

Start the MFA setup process. Pick **Authenticator app** from the Select Method
screen, and press Next.

Open your authentication app on your phone, and either:

- Scan the displayed barcode with the app.
- Manually enter the displayed secret key into the app.

Once you have set up the app and can see codes being generated, click Next.
Enter the verification code generated by the app to verify MFA setup.

## Logging in using your app

Login to your SilverStripe CMS account with your email and password. You’ll then
be prompted to enter a verification code from your authenticator app on your
phone.
